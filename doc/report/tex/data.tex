\section{Data pre-processing}
\label{sec:data}

This section details any and all data pre-processing before modelling.
The first section \vref{subsec:cleaning} explains what was done to
convert the dataset to usable, unambiguous types.
Afterwards section \vref{subsec:feature} details the what was
done to select and improve the features feed to the model.
Finally section \vref{subsec:splitting} breaks down the train/test split.


\subsection{Data cleaning}
\label{subsec:cleaning}

% birth date
converted to timestamps


% country of origin
On importing the dataset all countries where converted
to the corresponding \emph{ISO 3166--1 alpha-2} representation.
Some inputs required special rules.
Especially ambiguous was \emph{dr} which
represents no country code this was converted to Dominican Republic (DO)
even if the race for these inputs suggests it's not (mostly white).

% categorical data
For categorical data, the classes where kept as is and turned into dummy class
variables.



\subsection{Feature engineering}
\label{subsec:feature}

% Earned dividends
This feature was always 0 for the dataset.
Since it conveys no useful information it was dropped.
If new samples include this value this decision will be reconsidered.

% Gender
All female, dropped.

% http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html
% low variace
% Univariate feature selection
% Recursive feature elimination
% Feature selection using SelectFromModel
% Feature selection as part of a pipeline


\subsection{Train/test splitting}
\label{subsec:splitting}

The train/test split was done holding out 40\% of the data for the test set.
Furthermore training was done using a suffle split with 30\% for validation.
